==================

After downloading fresh hot WebStorm 7 EPA wanted to see how it integrates with karma - new test runner.

If you've installed it earlier, make sure to update node packages

To make it work you'll need nodejs with karma installed.

HOW TO (tested on Windows 8 Pro):

 install node.js
 in node.js command prompt run
 npm install -g karma@canary
 npm install -g karma-coverage

To run tests select karma.conf.js and run
To run tests with coverage execute Run wih coverage.
